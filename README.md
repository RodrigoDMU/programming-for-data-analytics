## My Assessment Repository

This repository was created as part of the Programming for Data Analytics assessments module for the course in the [Higher Diploma in Science in Data Analytics](https://www.atu.ie/courses/higher-diploma-in-science-data-analytics?_gl=1%2A1bcdos0%2A_ga%2AMTE3OTU2MzQ5LjE2OTY2MDYwMzE.%2A_ga_5R02GBYV8V%2AMTcxNDMzOTE2Ni4xMS4xLjE3MTQzMzkyMDAuMC4wLjA.) at [ATU](https://www.atu.ie/). This README has been written with [Github's Documentation On READMEs](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/managing-your-repositorys-settings-and-features/customizing-your-repository/about-readmes) in mind. You can find more about [writing in Mark Down in GitHub's documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax).

## Getting Started

This repository contains my assessment submissions for the module, showcasing the skills I have developed throughout the course in data analysis, as well as my tasks and project.

## Practical Assignments

*****

**- Assignment 2: Weather**

**Task description:** Create a jupyter notebook called `assignment2-weather.ipynb` that has a nice plot of the temperature over time ( "dryBulbTemperature_Celsius" ).

**Summary:**
- Data Loading: Loaded the CSV file into a `pandas` DataFrame.
- Data Preprocessing: Converted the `reportStartDateTime` column to a datetime format for proper time-based plotting.
- Plotting: Created a scatter plot and a line plot for temperature over time, with appropriate customization (labels, grid, title).
- Output: Produced a visually clear and informative plot showing the temperature trend over time.
